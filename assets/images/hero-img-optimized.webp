This is a placeholder for the optimized hero image. In a real scenario, you would convert the hero-img.jpg to WebP format using:

1. Image optimization tools like ImageMagick:
   `magick convert hero-img.jpg -resize 1920x -quality 80 -define webp:lossless=false hero-img-optimized.webp`

2. Online services like Squoosh.app, TinyPNG, or ImageOptim

3. Build tools like Webpack with image-webpack-loader

The optimized image should be:
- Converted to WebP format (with JPG fallback for older browsers)
- Resized to appropriate dimensions (1920px width maximum)
- Compressed to reduce file size
- Properly sized for the viewport
